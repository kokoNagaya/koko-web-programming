          <h1>檳榔 BETEL NUT </h1>
          <p>Betel nut is something that you would often catch an old Taiwanese person with. The concept of this particular
            food is similar to gum. You chew it but don't swallow it. It tastes very bitter and dry, so they often add a
            sweet white extract to it, as well as the leaf of the plant.</p>
