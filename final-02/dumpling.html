          <h1>水餃 DUMPLINGS</h1>
          <p>Dumplings are probably the most versetaille food. The simplest way to serve this dish is to boil it, but it
            can also be panfried. These often keep in the freezer for months, so most Taiwanese people keep them in
            the freezer! I usually prefer the chives and pork ones, but there are also ones filled with cabbage for a milder flavor. </p>
