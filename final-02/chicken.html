            <h1>FRIED CHICKEN</h1>
            <p>Unlike Western fried chicken, these are often chicken fillet that has been butterflied and pounded. They are often heavily
              doused with white pepper and sometimes chilli flakes. These are often found in night markets and are eaten whilst people walk
              around the market. Made to be easy to eat, they are usually put in small paper bags and held by hands.</p>
