            <h1>PAN-FRIED BUNS</h1>
            <p>This is a kind of buns filled with a pork filling. They are usuallt fried in a pan then steamed in the same pan. This allows for a
              crispy bottom and soft fluffy bread interior, when opened, the juice of the meat spills out and soaks the bread. These are often eaten as
              a snack food and enjoyed as an appetizer in some restaurants.</p>
