            <h1>米漿 RICE MILK</h1>
            <p>Rice milk is similar to soy milk, in a way that they are both plant based milk. However, different to the rice milk we often get
              at the supermarkets in the west, rice milk served in Taiwan are often brown and has a thicker consistency. They are usually
              served warm in a bowl, and actually eaten with a spoon. Many people also often enjoy dipping Shao Bing and You Tiao into the rice milk! </p>
